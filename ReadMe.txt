Honestly Amazon web services was completely new to me, as such everything from this class involving it and docker were completely new concepts to me. 
When it comes to the digital field the world is turning more onto two fronts, cloud and AI, and this class covered a huge chunk of the cloud field.
	My strengths as a developer definitely lie in the doing aspect of making things. I, given enough time, can make most anything I need to. 
My issue therein lies in describing what I have to do or am doing. I have never really been the best at describing my actions to someone. 
I just do what I do and don’t think about it too much, so when it comes to explaining myself, it can be difficult at times, which is why the final project was hard for me.
	When it comes to planning for growth there are a lot of challenges for businesses. There is a chance your product will be completely overlooked and 
lead to nothing, and there is a chance that your project will completely blow up and turn into a global sensation. The best way to estimate costs and 
scaling is to either set up overkill for what you need, set up a scaling plan with a service, or just hope that what you get works. The more cost predictable 
is of course containered services as you have a guaranteed cost for it. The machines that you bought and are running it on as well as power and the people to run it. 
You can gauge that really well. Whereas if you have serverless then if you have your service take off you can end up paying way more than planned.
	The biggest factor on what I will decide on for a business is if they are large or small to start. Have a small business that has one location? 
Have a small serverless setup to host their site and payment portal. Have a project where you have a medium sized company with projections? Go with a local container 
that you can dedicate resources to. Each place has it’s own situation that will lend to the path they should lead.
